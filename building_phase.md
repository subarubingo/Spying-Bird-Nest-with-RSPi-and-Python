# Building the nest box and python code

We considered purchasing a bird nest box, but frankly they were too expensive and/or had issues with installing raspi and the apparatus. So we headed to Home Depot to get some materials.

## Hardware
We bought the following items:
 - One pressure-treated wood board (1.25 inches thich, 4 inches wide, 8 ft long)
 - Hinge (two pack)
 - Wood stain

We purchased the pressure-treated (PT) wood thinking that it will have a good chance of withstanding the weather damages. However, later we learned that birds prefer natural wood so the PT wood was not the best choice after all. Oh well -- we at least dried the wood under the direct sunlight as much as we can.

Anyhow, the construction begun on Marchh 14, 2021.
